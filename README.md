Social Media platform where you can share your favorite music and check other people's favorites

## Description
During the course 'Server Side Scripting Frameworks' we need to create a personal project in which we are using all of the different methods that we have learned from the course. In this assignment, we need to keep security in mind to prevent other students from accessing functions that they are not supposed to have. For my personal project I decided to go with a social media platform where users can have three different levels of privilege. 

### Attack Surface
The other students are able to become artists and admins, which both have access to functionalities that I do not want them to have, so there is an attack surface they could abuse, but it is going to be my goal to not leave vulnerabilities in the system which they could abuse to gain these roles.
